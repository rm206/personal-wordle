# personal-wordle

A simple command line Wordle in Python. I made it simply because I love playing Wordle and I wanted to dip my hands in Python.

Clone the repo in the directory you want and run the following commands from your terminal :

```
pip3 install random_word
pip3 install enchant
```
Run the following command from the cloned directory to run the game : 

```
python3 wordle.py
```
Please note ; The ```enchant``` module has a known problem with Apple Silicon Macs. Please see [this](https://pyenchant.github.io/pyenchant/install.html) link for more.
